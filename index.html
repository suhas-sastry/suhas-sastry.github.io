                <h1>Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineer</h1>
                <h2>I am a mechanical engineer with experience or education in mechatronics, control systems, medical devices, vehicle engineering, composites, and battery engineering. I'm very excited to work on robotic systems, process equipment, medical devices, and public transit or utility systems, and I am currently seeking entry-level or associate mechanical engineering roles in those sectors. I'm also considering mechanical engineering roles outside of those fields, and am always thrilled to participate in new and groundbreaking engineering projects! You can see some samples of my previous work under the "Portfolio" tab.</h2>
