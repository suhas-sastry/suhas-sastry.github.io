            <h1>Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineer</h1>
            <h2>I am a multidisciplinary mechanical engineer with experience in mechatronics, control systems, medical devices, vehicle engineering, composites, and battery engineering. I especially enjoy working in robotics, mechatronics, control systems, medical devices, and vehicle engineering, and I am currently seeking entry-level mechanical engineering roles in those fields. I am also considering mechanical engineering roles outside of those fields, and am very excited to participate in new and groundbreaking engineering projects!</h2>
