                <h1>Miniature-Scale Basketball Robot</h1>
                <h2>My team and I built a robot to play miniature-scale basketball for the Stanford ME218B (mechatronics) final project. The robot delivered balls to the basket using a flywheel-based launching mechanism, and was loaded a single ball at a time using a servo-based magazine-style loading mechanism. The robot was programmed using three PIC32 ICs communicating over SPI. I designed and built the loading mechanism, constructed parts of the launching mechanism, soldered motor control and power distribution boards, and wrote services for the project codebase.

                <h1>SPI Arcade Machine</h1>
                <h2>My team and I built an arcade machine for a jetpack target shooting game for the Stanford ME218A (mechatronics) final project. This arcade machine accepted analog input from a joystick and digital inputs from a push-button and a Hall effect sensor, and featured responsive light and fan feedback to player input. The machine also featured a servo-based game clock display. The arcade machine was programmed using one PIC32 IC and a buffered dot matrix display. I designed schematics, wired circuits, manufactured enclosure components, wrote services, tested hardware and software, and created pixel art.

We created a lookahead controller and a PID controller, both of which were successfully run on the Stanford CARS Lab test vehicle. I wrote and revised sections of the control algorithms, tuned gains, and ran simulations to evaluate controller performance.
