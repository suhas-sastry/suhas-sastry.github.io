                <h1>Coater Automation Control Box</h1>
                <h2>I laid out, assembled, wired, and tested the internal systems of a control box for a custom coating machine used by Neptune Medical's Cardiovascular and Gastrointestinal teams. Working from diagrams and a bill of materials created by the lead engineer of the project, I created part layouts, implemented mounting methods, and routed wires, external cables, and pneumatic tubes. I also attached caster wheels, stands, and a handle to the box enclosure for ease of transport.</h2>
                <h2>I used Microsoft Visio to create 2D layouts of the control box panel, reviewed designs with the the lead engineer, and chose an appropriate layout. I mounted all hardware with tapped holes and screws, zip ties, or both. I mounted the Intelligent Power Center to a separate aluminum plate, allowing for easy power supply replacement.</h2>
                <h2>I wired all high-voltage and logic-level DIN rail hardware, including a safety circuit with an emergency stop switch and a custom length 120VAC cable. I tested each stage of the safety circuit, probed for connections between live, neutral, and ground, tested each high-voltage relay, and confirmed that each pneumatic solenoid valve fired when activated.</h2>

                <h1>Tube Holding Clip For Coating Machine</h1>
                <h2>I designed a clip to hold two tubes within a custom coating machine for Neptune Medical. The issue presented involved two solution-covered tubes being left loose during the current coating procedure, and the operating engineers asked for clips to be attached to 8020 rails in order to hold the loose tubes. I created multiple iterations using 3D-printed FORM resin components and custom-cut EPTFE, tested each iteration using 1/8" tubing, and revised designs based on performance and feedback from the engineers using the coating machine. The final clip iteration holds the tube in two locations for better stability, with EPTFE pieces held on by screws threaded into the 3D-printed base.</h2>

The design objective for the roll cage was to provide adequate head protection for the driver in the event of various crash scenarios while maintaining the lowest roll cage mass possible. I conducted generative design studies in Fusion 360, helped choose an optimal design from the generated options, and simulated the roll cage subject to load cases of [-4g, 1.5g, -5g] and 5g in any direction. The roll cage was manufactured out of aluminum by Uniformity Labs using SLM additive manufacturing.</h2>
